### Keys
To work on **TTS** or **STT** You will need to fill in the required values, see **_config.yml**.

### Scripts
If you want to make use of the python scripts provided in the base directory, take a look at the **developer_requirements.txt**, you can install these through the use of ```pip install -r developer_requirements.txt``` (On windows you might need to install Python first, and for Linux you might want to use pip3 for installing the dependencies in python3 instead of 2). 

I also recommend make use of **Pyenv** and **Virtualenv** for managing Python versions and dependencies.
